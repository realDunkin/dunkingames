Overcoming the challenges and dangerous obstacles of each level is the way to show off your superior driving skills. Players will be given a star rating between one and three based on the final result at each level's end. Because this game is fully time-based and each level has a target time, players need to complete the mission in the shortest time possible to earn all three stars. Even though the first few levels may make achieving three stars appear easy, the later stages will put you through your paces if you want to achieve perfection and continue on to the next challenge. The game has a star system that lets players use the stars they've earned to buy brand-new motorbikes."
